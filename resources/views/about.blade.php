          <p>
            At Careseekers, we have combined our passion for empowering people to live with dignity and independence with our love of technology to create a platform where people needing aged care or disability support can connect with workers - on their own terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Experience has taught us that the right care or support worker can be a person you build a genuine, ongoing relationship with, who understands your needs and abilities and who can support you to achieve your life goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Having the right support match is so much better than having a rotating list of workers coming in and out of your daily life, which can be exhausting and frustrating.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Careseekers, we believe that technology should be an enabler, not a roadblock to finding care and support workers. Our technology can allow you to quickly identify workers that may be the right match, as you search by gender, skills, experience, and shared interests.
          </p>

          <p>
            To enable you to find your best worker match, we have built a background checked, diverse community of independent aged care and disability support workers across Australia who feel passionately about the work they do.
          </p>

          <p>
            Behind our platform, we have a whole team of people to support you and help connect you with care and support workers. You are not on your own when you use the Careseekers platform.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Careseekers, we value:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
            <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> We empower care seekers to live with independence, choice, control, and dignity; we empower care workers to take control of their working lives.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Our actions, words, decisions, and choices are made with integrity and reflect who we are as a company and people. We are proud of what we do every day, but more than that we are proud of how we do it.</li>
            <li><strong>Positivity:</strong> We start with a ‘yes’. We see what can be done because we believe in what is possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Lives and situations can be complex and challenging. We will find solutions to problems by thinking outside the box.</li>
            <li><strong>Care:</strong> Care is at the heart of what we do. We care about our customers, we care about the work we do on a daily basis, and we care about how we do it.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            At Careseekers, we promote choice and control over care and support and work opportunities for care and support workers. It is, after all, the platform built around you.
